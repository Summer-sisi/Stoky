## How to submit a bug report

Before submitting a new issue on Github please search for
similar issues to avoid duplicates.

Please do not ask questions or request help with your setup by submitting an issue.
For that refer to https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/search-guard

Github is a place only for reporting bugs or feature requests.
If you report a bug please include always the following informations:

* Search Guard and Elasticsearch version
* JVM version and operating system version
* Number of nodes in your cluster
* Description of the bug

These informations are optional but are very valueable and
typically would lead to get bugs fixed faster:

* Steps to reproduce
* Logfiles on DEBUG level
