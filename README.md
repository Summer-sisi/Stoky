If you want to use our enterprise features in production, you need to obtain a license. We offer a [very flexible licensing model](https://floragunn.com/searchguard/searchguard-license-support/), based on productive clusters with an **unlimited number of nodes**. Non-productive systems like Development, Staging or QA are covered by the license at no additional cost.

## Trial license

You can test all enterprise modules for 60 days. A trial license is automatically created when you first install Search Guard. You do not have to install the trial license manually. Just install Search Guard and you're good to go! 

## Quick Start

* Install Elasticsearch

* Install the Search Guard plugin for your [Elasticsearch version](https://github.com/floragunncom/search-guard/wiki), e.g.:

```
<ES directory>/bin/elasticsearch-plugin install \
  -b com.floragunn:search-guard-6:6.0.0-17.beta1
```

* ``cd`` into ``<ES directory>/plugins/search-guard-<version>/tools``

* Execute ``./install_demo_configuration.sh``, ``chmod`` the script first if necessary. This will generate all required TLS certificates and add the Search Guard configuration to your ``elasticsearch.yml`` file. 

* Start Elasticsearch

* Test the installation by visiting ``https://localhost:9200``. When prompted, use admin/admin as username and password. This user has full access to the cluster.

* Display information about the currently logged in user by visiting ``https://localhost:9200/_searchguard/authinfo``.

* Deep dive into all Search Guard features by reading the [Search Guard documentation](http://docs.search-guard.com)

## Config hot reloading

The Search Guard configuration is stored in a dedicated index in Elasticsearch itself. Changes to the configuration are pushed to this index via the [sgadmin command line tool](https://github.com/floragunncom/search-guard-docs/blob/master/sgadmin.md). This will trigger a reload of the configuration on all nodes automatically. This has several advantages over configuration via elasticsearch.yml:

* Configuration is stored in a central place
* No configuration files on the nodes necessary
* Configuration changes do not require a restart
* Configuration changes take effect immediately
